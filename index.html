MeshModeler crated by Zachary Ferguson
© 2015 Zachary Ferguson

3D Modeler for creating and editing meshes. Contains the functionality to change
heights, fractalize, and smooth out meshes. Can also be used to create meshes 
and export as an OBJ file for editing in 3D modeling software like Autodesk's 
Maya.

Any bugs or suggestions can be emailed to zfergus2@gmu.edu.

Thank you for using MeshModeler.
