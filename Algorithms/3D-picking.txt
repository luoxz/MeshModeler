3D Vertex Picking
Zachary Ferguson

Let E be the Eye world coordinates, C be the viewing direction where |C| is the 
viewing distance, U be the up vector, and theta and phi are the view half 
angles.

Convert the point selected in Normalized Device Coordinates to world coordinates
and use it to create a ray equation in 3D space.

Step 1: Compute the horizontal screen vector, H, at the point E.

	a. A = C x U, where A||H and starts at E.
	b. H = (A*|C|*tan(theta))/(|A|), rescale A to H.
	
Step 2: Compute the vertical screen vector, V, at the point E.

	a. B = A x C, where B||V and starts at E.
	b. V = (B*|C|*tan(phi))/(|B|), rescale B to V.
	
Step 3: Compute the midpoint of the screen, M.

	a. M = E + C.
	
Step 4: Compute P, the point in world 2D coordinates that the user points at, 
given the point in Normalized Device Coordinates, (s_x, s_y), where 
0 <= s_x <= 1 and 0 <= s_y <= 1.

	a. P = M + (2*s_x - 1) * H + (2*s_y - 1) * V.
	
Step 5: Compute the ray equation, R.
	
	a. R = E + (t*(P - E))/(|P-E|), where t is the independent variable.
	
Check for the vertices that the ray passes through, within a radius of r from 
the vertex.
	
Step 6: For each vertex, v, in the mesh, compute the distance from v to the ray, 
R, computed in step 5. If the distance is less than or equal to r, then select 
that vertex.

	a. R_01 = R(1) - R(0), where R_01 is the direction vector of the ray.
	b. d = |(R_01 x (v - R(0)))|, where d is the distance from the point to the
	   ray and R(0) is the rays origin.
	c. If d <= r, then select v.
