Step 1: Sub-divide the mesh to create new vertices between the original ones.

	a.Use the original mesh to create a new mesh.
	b.Copy over the values of the original mesh.
	c.Add new rows and cols between the original rows and cols while copying.

Step 2: Change the new vertices' height value to a value specified by a random 
function. The range of the random function is half the previous range that the 
fractalize function was called.

	a. Iterate over the new vertices
	b. Set their height to be the result of the random function.

Step 3: Set the mesh to be drawn to the newly fractalized mesh.
