<strong>Step 1:</strong> Sub-divide the mesh to create new vertices between the 
original ones.
<ol>
	<li>
		Use the original mesh to create a new mesh.
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy over the values of the original mesh.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add new rows and cols between the original rows and cols while copying.
		<br>
		These new vertices' heights should be the average of the adjacent 
		original vertices' heights.
	</li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Change the new vertices' height value to a value 
specified by a random function. <br>
The range of the random function is half the previous range that the fractalize
function was called.
<ol>
	<li>
		Iterate over the new vertices
	</li>
	<li>
		Change their heights by the result of the random function.
	</li>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the mesh to be drawn to the newly fractalized mesh.
