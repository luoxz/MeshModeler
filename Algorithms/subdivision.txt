Step 1: For each face in the mesh, create a new vertex at the center of the 
face.

	a. Average the face vertices' x, y, and z values.
	b. Create a new vertex with these x, y, and z (center vertex).

Step 2: For each edge in the mesh, create a new edge midpoint vertex that is the
average of the adjacent edge vertices and the adjacent face vertices.

	a. Sum the two adjacent edge vertices and the two adjacent face vertices 
	   created in "Step 1".
	b. Divide this sum by four to yield the new edge vertex.

Step 3: Update the original vertices to be an weighted average of the 
surrounding face centres, new edge midpoints, and vertex.

	a. Sum all of the face vertices for the faces that the vertex is part of, 
	   then divide the sum by the number of edges connected to the vertex.
	b. Sum all of the midpoints of the edges that the vertex is part of, then 
	   multiply the sum by 2 and divide by the number of edges connected to the 
	   vertex.
	c. Multiply the vertex that is being updated by (the number of edges 
	   connected to the vertex - 3) and then divide by the  number of edges 
	   connected to the vertex.
	d. Update the vertex being updated to be the sum of the results from a, b, 
	   and c.
